# 1. Introduction

The Magic Card Definition (MCD) format provides a declarative, rule-faithful schema to define Magic: The Gathering cards in a structured way. It is designed for use with modular engines (such as in C#) that execute all game logic based on this data. Cards are stored in `.lua` files and structured as nested tables with strong semantic meaning.

MCD is not a text parser. It is a **rule representation language**.
