# 9. Zones & Targets

Zones define where cards are located in the game: hand, battlefield, graveyard, exile, etc.  
Targets describe which card or player is the subject of an action.

MCD supports full zone logic for all legal transitions (e.g., hand â†’ battlefield).  
Targeting paths can use dotted notation (e.g., `TargetPlayer.Graveyard.TopCard`) and support both direct and dynamic selection. Zones are referenced in many effect types and trigger conditions.

**Zones are referenced with:**
- `from_zone`, `to_zone`
- `TargetPlayer.Graveyard.TopCard`

**Common zone keywords:**

| Keyword       | Description                     |
|---------------|---------------------------------|
| `Library`     | Player's deck                   |
| `Graveyard`   | Discard pile                    |
| `Hand`        | Player's hand                   |
| `Exile`       | Exile zone                      |
| `Battlefield` | Cards in play                   |
| `Stack`       | Spells/abilities in process     |
| `Command`     | Command zone (Commander, emblems, etc.) |

**Example:**

```lua
effect = {
  type = "MoveCard",
  target = "TargetCreature",
  from_zone = "Battlefield",
  to_zone = "Exile"
}
```
